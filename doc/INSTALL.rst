Installation
============

To install the PyLipID Python package, you need a few Python package dependencies. These dependencies
include:

- mdtraj
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- networkx
- scipy
- python-louvain
- logomaker
- statsmodels
- scikit-learn
- tqdm
- kneebow

If these dependencies are not available in their required versions, the installation will fail. We thus
recommend using the package installer pip:

``pip install pylipid``

If you know what you are doing and want to build from the source, the package is also available for
download on Github via:

``git clone https://github.com/wlsong/PyLipID``
